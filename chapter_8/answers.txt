q1 - no its not part of the standard python library... so we have do use 'pip install --user pyinputplus' for installation

q2 - we use import pyinputplus as pyip so that we don't have to write the whole pyinputplus everytime to use it.

q3 - inputInt() only allows for integer input whereas inputFloat() only allows for floating integer input.

q4 - pyip.inputInt(min=0, lessThan=100)

q5 - allowRegex gets the values in the form of regular expressions that are allowed as a valid input and the opposite in the case of blockRegex.

q6 - it gives a retrylimitexception. 

q7 - it prints 'hello' when blank input is entered 3 times.
