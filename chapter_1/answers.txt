q1 - *,-,/,+ <- operators
   - 'hello', -88.8, 5 <- values

q2 - spam <- variable and 'spam' <- string
 
q3 - string(str), integer(int), floating integer(float)

q4 - operators + variable + method invocations.

q5 - "expression” is a combination of values and functions that are combined and interpreted by the compiler to create a new value. "Statement" is a standalone unit of execution that doesn't return anything.

q6 - 20 

q7 - both return the same thing ie 'spamspamspam'

q8 - No because variables can't begin with numbers.

q9 - floating point number - float(variable), integer - int(variable), string - str(variable)

q10 - because we are asking the editors to print a mix of string and int, to change this we could use : 'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'

len() returns the number of items in an object.
round() returns a floating point number that is a rounded version of the number.
