q1 - *dictionary name* = {}

q2 - dict = {'foo':42}

q3 - list is mainly for ordered collection of values, whereas a dictionary data type is mostly a collection of datatypes that are used to store unordered values. 

q4 - it gives and error because there is no key by the name 'foo'

q5 - there is no difference because the 'cats' in spam also check for 'cats' in the keys the only difference would be if it were to check for 'cats' in spam.values()

q6 - 'cats' in spam checks for the keys in the dictionary data type whereas the 'cats' in spam.values() checks if the 'cats' is a value of any of the keys.

q7 - spam.setdefault('color','black') <- this would check if the key exists if yes, then it would output the value else if not it would create a new key and store the value 'black' in it.

q8 - the module to be imported is - pprint
   - the functions that can be used to 'pretty print' are - pprint.pprint() or pprint.pformat()
