q1 - re.compile() we import this to use regex objects.

q2 - Like the things don't have to escaped. Its used to keep regular expressions meaningful and confusion-free.

q3 - it searches for the regex objects in a passed string and returns the found data.

q4 - we use group()

q5 - group 0 would have the complete found  using search()
     group 1 would have the values form the 1st paranthesis
     group 2 would have the values from the 2nd paranthesis ie (\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d)

q6 - we would have to escape the paranthesis and period using \ 

q7 - when we use group() with findall() it returns a list of tuples of strings. if the group() is not used it returns a list of strings.

q8 - | is used for choosing OR in a regular expression. When both occur the 1st instance is chosen.

q9 - The ? character flags the group that precedes it as an optional part of the pattern and ? is also used denote that we desire python to use the non-greedy uproach.

q10 - * means “match zero or more,” the + (or plus) means “match one or more”

q11 - {3} is used for searching for only 3 instances. whereas {3,5} accepts instances 3, 4 and 5. 

q12 - \d - for digits [0-9]
    - \w - for all alphabets + digits ie [a-zA-Z0-9]
    - \s - for all white space characters
